# Composting-App-UX Design
## Project Title:
weCompost

## A Background Story
This app provides users with creative ways of reducing food waste through composting.  I learned about the problem space through the 
problem of food waste, the different sectors that generate this waste, and different Canadian and global technical and 
non-technical initiatives that have been put in place to tackle this food waste problem. I also discussed with friends. 

My target audience includes:
* Farming enthusiasts
* Families
* Students
* Schools, food retailers, restaurants and hotels

In order to cater to the variety in my target audience, the application will provide different sign up modes for the users. 

To create a solution:
* I wrote a list of possible features for the app, drawing inspiration from already existing apps with similar features 
* I hand-sketched wireframes for the different screens for the features
* I then created high-fidelity mock-ups of the user flows for the chosen features

According to CBC.ca, initiatives such as The Community Cabbage in Victoria, British Columbia, Waste Free Lunch Challenge in Ontario, and 
restaurants like The Sprout, Osco! and Terra Breads are all working towards choices that reduce food waste. Mobile applications such as 
Ubisoft and Feedback which are active in Montreal and Toronto respectively provide real-time push notification to users on discounted food, and offer time-specific deals on food 
items from great restaurants in the city.

The features I decided to focus on for my design were **_“Barcode”_**, **_“Progress”_** and **_“Insights”_**. 
* **_“Barcode”_** allows users to scan the barcodes of the compostable items they want to donate
* **_“Progress”_** enables users are able to set three monthly waste-reduction goals and track their progress towards their desired goal, 
allowing for the formation of food conservation or repurposing habits. They are also able to navigate to the “My Progress” 
screen to view their donation history
* The **_“Insights”_** feature provides a forum where users can share and view tips on better composting habits or related subjects
